# NeonpadCPP

This is my "easy" proyect. I purpose this in February but is still hard for me yet because i only made console app with cpp. This is my first proyect who has an GUI (Interface User) and i decided to make an notepad for my future proyects.

Feel free to use this and make any feedback what you want!

>Note: Only __WIN32_ Supported

## Features
 - Change Font (New)
 - Text Area
 - New option
 - Save and Open
 - Save As option

## Last Update (25 February)
I added Fonts, is too poor the code and very basic but is all i can do for now. I wanna follow this system for a while so i gonna implement almost all fonts that includes Microsoft. The "Font Size" Option dosn't work yet I don't know how i can that works with [that code](https://github.com/neopkr/NeonpadCPP/blob/8b340961251d40b212546444d10ecedc71afe324/WinMain.cpp#L189).

> Update: I finally got a Font Size but is the worst form posible, i will try to reoptimize the code later for the other fonts.

## Future View of the Proyect
I trying to make an very easy interface for everyone. At the same time the notepad has be an IDE in totally by a option in Edit or maybe i can make an IDE, but that is so hard for me yet. This IDE can be count with:
  - Intellisense
  - Support with any language
  - ETC

Basically, an normal IDE haha.

## Installation
You can use ```$ git clone ...``` or download zip. Soon (when i clear some bugs), I will upload it in Release Option.
