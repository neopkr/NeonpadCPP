# NeonpadCPP

This is my "easy" proyect. I purpose this in February but is still hard for me yet because i only made console app with cpp. This is my first proyect who has an GUI (Interface User) and i decided to make an notepad for my future proyects.

Feel free to use this and make any feedback what you want!

## Features
 - Text Area
 - New option
 - Save and Open
 - Save As option

## Future View of the Proyect
I trying to make an very easy interface for everyone. At the same time the notepad has be an IDE in totally by a option in Edit or maybe i can make an IDE, but that is so hard for me yet. This IDE can be count with:
  - Intellisense
  - Support with any language
  - ETC

Basically, an normal IDE haha.

## Installation
You can use ```$ git clone ...``` or download zip. Soon (when i clear some bugs), I will upload it in Release Option.
